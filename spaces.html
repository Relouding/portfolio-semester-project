                <h3>Cosmology</h3>
                    <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and
                    what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that
                    can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our
                    solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in
                    our solar system.</p>
                <h3>Evolution</h3>
                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come
                    from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring
                    and understanding our place in this world. Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know
                    today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including
                    our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>
                <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
                    <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the
                    great wonders of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much
                    improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                    medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. 
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
                    Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
                <h3>Robotics and AI</h3>
                    <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future. From useful
                    home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of
                    Rob the Robot.</p>
                <h3>Ecology</h3>
                    <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists
                    explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. In our ecology section of the museum,
                    we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on
                    the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
